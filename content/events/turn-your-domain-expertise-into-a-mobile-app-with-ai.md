In this presentation and workshop, we’ll explore how domain experts and knowledge workers can turn their expertise into a mobile app using AI, through an approach often referred to as vibe coding (also known as coding with AI or spec driven development).

Instead of focusing on code or technical implementation details, the session centers on understanding intent, decision-making, and real-world judgment, and how AI can help translate that thinking into software.

To make the concepts concrete, Mark will walk through a real example called Trail Palette, a mobile weather app designed for outdoor photographers. Drawing on his experience spending countless hours in mountainous terrain as both a guide and photographer, Mark brings an intuitive understanding of how weather, light, and landscape interact, and how that domain knowledge shapes the logic and behavior of an app.

This session is designed for non-developers who want a clear mental model of what it takes to build a mobile app using AI. Along with a hands-on workshop, you’ll gain an understanding of the tools involved and inspiration to see how your own domain expertise could become the foundation for software.

### Key Topics Covered

1. Domain expertise is the foundation of meaningful AI-powered apps, not coding skills.
2. Building a mobile app with AI starts with intent, decision-making, and real-world judgment.
3. Vibe coding is about guiding AI through clear descriptions of what you want to achieve, not writing code.
4. Understanding basic app concepts like screens, flows, and logic helps non-developers collaborate effectively with AI.
5. Any domain expert can apply this approach to turn their own knowledge into useful, purpose-driven software.
