#### Unlocking the Strategic Mindset of AI
A presentation by Sharad Aggarwal, Global Head of Strategy & AI Solutions @ Google Cloud

In this presentation, Sharad Aggarwal, Global Head of Strategy & AI Solutions at Google Cloud, breaks down how non-technical professionals can think strategically about AI, without needing to code. Sharad shares how organizations actually adopt AI at scale, where most teams get stuck, and how business leaders, domain experts, and knowledge workers can stay relevant and impactful in an AI-driven world. If you work with ideas, decisions, strategy, or product building, this event will help you rethink how AI fits into your role and how to stay ahead as expectations continue to shift.
