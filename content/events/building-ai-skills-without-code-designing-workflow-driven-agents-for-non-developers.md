You don't need to be a developer to build powerful AI agents. In this session, you'll learn how to transform repeatable workflows into AI skills, modular, reusable instruction sets that guide AI through complex multi-step tasks. No coding required. 

We'll walk through the full design process: mapping workflows visually before writing anything, applying progressive disclosure to manage AI context, creating user-configurable settings, and packaging skills that follow the emerging Agent Skills standard. 

To bring it all together, we'll build a simple AI skill live from scratch. Whether you're a product manager, content creator, or business professional, you'll leave with a practical framework for turning any structured process into an AI skill you can share and iterate on.

### Key Topics Covered

1. No-code AI agents and skills
2. Workflow-to-skill design
3. Progressive context management
4. Reusable AI instruction patterns
5. Live AI skill creation
