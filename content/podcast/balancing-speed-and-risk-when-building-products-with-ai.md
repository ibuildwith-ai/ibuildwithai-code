In this episode, I sit down with Akshay Sura, Co-Founder of Konabos, to explore how teams can balance speed to market with risk when building products with AI. We talk about the rise of vibe coding and rapid AI-assisted development, where it works well, and where it can introduce real risks if left unchecked. Akshay shares practical insights on putting the right checks and balances in place, keeping humans in the loop, and knowing when to slow down just enough to build products that are not only fast, but trustworthy and scalable.

### Key Topics Covered

1. Vibe coding and rapid AI-assisted development
2. Speed to market vs product and security risk
3. Human-in-the-loop checks and guardrails
4. When to move fast and when to slow down
5. Scaling AI products with trust and governance
