Before you build an AI voice agent, there's a lot more to think through than just picking a model or plugging into a voice API. In this episode, Nadaa Taiyab, Fractional Head of AI, shares hard-won lessons from building real-world, HIPAA-compliant voice agents and leading AI initiatives from concept to production. The conversation explores what actually makes a voice agent useful in practice: the underlying model architecture, how to design conversations that feel natural, and how choices around personality, vocal quality, and prompting shape user trust and outcomes.

Nadaa also breaks down why seemingly simple voice workflows, like form filling and structured information capture, can be some of the hardest to get right. From latency and turn-taking to accents, edge cases, and production tradeoffs, this episode is a practical guide for founders, product teams, AI builders and anyone else who want to create voice agents powered by AI that work in the real world, not just in demos.

Key Topics Covered
	1.	What to know before building an AI voice agent
	2.	Voice agent architecture and stack design (including models, turn-taking, and core components)
	3.	Conversation design, personality, and prompt engineering for better user experience
	4.	Voice quality, accents, and trust in real-world interactions
	5.	Why "simple" workflows like form filling are hard—and what production teams should expect
