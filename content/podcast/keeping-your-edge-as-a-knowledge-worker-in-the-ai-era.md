In this episode, I sit down with Sharad Aggarwal, Global Head of Strategy and AI/ML Solutions, to talk about what it really means to stay valuable in the AI era. As AI accelerates the speed of work, expectations for knowledge workers, domain experts, and business professionals are changing fast.

We explore why AI is no longer just a competitive advantage but a baseline skill, how expertise alone is no longer enough, and what it means to use AI as a force multiplier rather than a replacement. This conversation focuses on mindset, practical application, and how professionals can keep their edge by working smarter, not just harder.

If you build, work with ideas, decisions, strategy, or expertise, this episode will help you rethink your role in a world where speed and leverage matter more than ever.
