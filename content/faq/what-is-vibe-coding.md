Vibe coding is the practice of using AI to quickly turn ideas into prototypes, tools, and workflows through conversation and iteration, without needing to write the code yourself.

As a domain expert and knowledge worker, you should care because it lets you apply your expertise directly. Instead of waiting on engineering cycles or learning a full tech stack, you can explore ideas, validate assumptions, and build useful artifacts faster. When paired with clear goals and basic structure, vibe coding becomes a practical way for knowledge workers to adapt to the new baseline where domain expertise and AI work together.
