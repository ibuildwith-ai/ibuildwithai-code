AI is powerful, but it does not understand your domain, your users, or your constraints unless you make those things explicit. As a domain expert, your value comes from knowing what matters, what does not, and how decisions affect real outcomes.

Knowing how to guide AI means translating that understanding into clear instructions, context, and expectations. When you do that, AI becomes an extension of your expertise. You get more accurate results, fewer misfires, and outputs that align with real-world needs instead of generic answers. 

This skill is becoming a core capability for anyone who turns knowledge into decisions, tools, or workflows.
