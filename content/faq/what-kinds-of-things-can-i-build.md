With AI, you can build the things you already know should exist in your domain. That includes prototypes to test ideas, internal tools that remove manual work, and workflows that automate repetitive or error-prone tasks.

Domain experts commonly use AI to create planning tools, decision support aids, content and data pipelines, dashboards, internal utilities, and early versions of applications used to validate needs with real users.
