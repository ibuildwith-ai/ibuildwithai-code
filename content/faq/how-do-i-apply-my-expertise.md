As a domain expert, you already know what tools are missing, which workflows are inefficient, and what users actually need. The challenge is not knowing what to build. It is turning that knowledge into something tangible.

AI lets you do that directly. By clearly describing your goals, constraints, and expected outcomes, you can guide AI to create prototypes, tools, and workflows that reflect how work really happens in your domain. With structure and intentional planning, AI handles the technical execution while you stay focused on shaping solutions based on your expertise.
