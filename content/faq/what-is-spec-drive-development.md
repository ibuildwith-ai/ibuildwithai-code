**Spec Driven Development (SDD)** is an approach where you and AI start by clearly defining what you want to build before generating anything. It focuses on making your intent explicit through goals, requirements, constraints, and examples so AI understands the problem space upfront.

For domain experts, this means capturing what you already know about users, workflows, and outcomes, then using that clarity to guide AI. The result is less rework, more consistent output, and prototypes, tools, or workflows that better reflect how things should actually work in your domain.

There are various frameworks today that support Spec Driven Development, including our very own, [Cody Product Builder](https://github.com/ibuildwith-ai/cody-product-builder).
