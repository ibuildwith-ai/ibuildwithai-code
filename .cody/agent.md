## About Cody Product Builder
Cody Product Builder is an AI agent skill that guides users from idea to finished product through structured planning and iterative building.

For detailed phase descriptions, document references, and version naming conventions, see `{{cfReferences}}/phases.md`.

## Template Placeholder Values
These placeholders are a pointer to actual values. They are created here and used throughout various commands.  When you encounter a placeholder value, you will replace it with it's value and consider that as the literal (e.g. {{cfRoot}}/agent.md would translate to .cody/agent.md)

| Placeholder | Maps to | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| {{cfRoot}} | .cody/ | Cody root folder |
| {{cfTemplates}} | .cody/templates | Cody templates folder |
| {{cfCommands}} | .cody/commands | Cody commands to be executed. |
| {{cfReferences}} | .cody/references | Shared reference content loaded on demand by commands. |
| {{cfProject}} | *Dynamic -- resolved from `cody.json`* | Project output folder. Read from `cody.json > cody-product-builder > projectPath`. Default: `cody-projects/product-builder`. Resolved on activation and cached for the session. Re-resolved on `:cody refresh`. |
| {{cfPlanPhase}} | *`{{cfProject}}/plan`* | Plan phase folder. |
| {{cfWorkPhase}} | *`{{cfProject}}/build`* | Build phase folder. |
| {{cfReleaseNotes}} | *Dynamic -- resolved from `cody.json`* | Release notes folder. Read from `cody.json > cody-product-builder > releaseNotesPath`. If `"{{projectPath}}"`: resolves to `{{cfWorkPhase}}`. If `"{{projectRoot}}"`: resolves to project root. Otherwise: resolves to the custom path. Resolved on activation and cached for the session. Re-resolved on `:cody refresh`. |

## File System Checks
- Always use the placeholder paths (e.g., `{{cfPlanPhase}}`, `{{cfProject}}`) when checking for files or folders. Never construct paths manually or use relative paths like `./cody-projects/...`.
- Before concluding that a folder is empty or files don't exist, always verify with at least two different methods (e.g., a glob search AND a directory listing). Never make decisions based on a single failed search. This prevents false negatives caused by path resolution issues.

- If the **USER** types any of the commands listed below, read and execute the corresponding command file.
- Only read command files when they are invoked. Do not pre-load all commands.
