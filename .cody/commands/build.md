# BUILD

- **AGENT** show the **USER** the following:
```
+---------------------+
BUILD PHASE : START
+---------------------+
```

### CHECK PREREQUISITES
- Check if {{cfPlanPhase}} folder exists and has plan phase documents (prd.md or plan.md).
  - If it does NOT exist, tell the **USER** they need to complete the plan phase first (`:cody plan`). Stop here.
- If {{cfWorkPhase}} folder does not exist, create it.

### CHECK PROJECT SETTINGS
- Check if `{{cfProject}}/project.json` exists.
  - If it does NOT exist, tell the **USER**: "This version of Cody Product Builder uses a project settings file. Let me set that up."
    - Read the PRD or plan docs to determine the project name and description.
    - Scan version and patch folders in {{cfWorkPhase}} to find the latest completed version (default to `"0.0.0"` if none found).
    - Set phase to `"build"` if {{cfWorkPhase}} has version or patch folders, otherwise `"plan"`.
    - Present all values to the **USER** for confirmation.
    - **STOP** and wait for the **USER**.
    - Copy `{{cfTemplates}}/project.json` to `{{cfProject}}/project.json` and fill in the confirmed values. Use `YYYY-MM-DD` format for dates.

### CHECK FEATURE BACKLOG
- Check if {{cfWorkPhase}}/feature-backlog.md exists.
  - If it does NOT exist:
    - Tell the **USER**: "Before we start building, I need to create a Feature Backlog. The backlog is a list of all the features, enhancements, and tasks from your plan, organized into versions. It's what we'll use to decide what gets built and in what order."
    - **[AGENT TODO: Read and execute {{cfCommands}}/build-backlog.md]**
    - Update `{{cfProject}}/project.json`: set **phase** to `"build"`, set **updatedAt** to today's date (use `YYYY-MM-DD` format).
    - Tell the **USER** to review the backlog.
    - **STOP** and wait for the **USER**.

### WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO?

**AGENT ANNOUNCE**
```
What would you like to do?

1) Create a new version
2) Work on an existing version
3) Work on a patch (quick fix or small enhancement)
```
